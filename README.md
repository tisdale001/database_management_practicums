# database_management_practicums

These projects were large practicums I completed for Database Management, CS5200, Northeastern University. Within these projects I use RStudio, R language, SQLite, and XML. During the course, we also used SQL and MySQL. I designed the relational database schemas using Lucidchart. Check out the '.nb' files to see the final results of the project.
